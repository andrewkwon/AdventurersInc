Quest Generation:
Start with a random pool of quests
Success or failure of a quest causes a new quest to be added to the quest pool, randomly chosen from a list of followup quests
i.e. Investigate dungeon successfully causes either magical research or trasure hunting to become available, failure causes investiage dungeon to be added back into the pool
Every now and then, new random quests will be added to the pool and old quests destroyed

Some quests may cause loops
i.e. slay vampire (success) -> investigate old castle (success) -> research strange relic (failure) -> slay vampire
interesting thought: scavenge wasteland (success/failure) -> scavenge wasteland

Quest risks:
Each quest has an injury rate and a death rate
Injury rate is the probability of an injury for each adventurer on the quest, injury incurs a fixed healing cost but otherwise has no consequences
Death rate is the probability of death for each adventurer given that the quest fails. There will be no deaths if the quest succeeds
